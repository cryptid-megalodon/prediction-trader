They could siphon votes from established parties, potentially impacting CDU/CSU's overall seat count, although current polls suggest they are hovering around the 5% threshold.\\n- **Economic and Geopolitical Events:** Unexpected economic shocks or major geopolitical events in the short time before the election could shift voter priorities and influence voting behavior in unpredictable ways.
